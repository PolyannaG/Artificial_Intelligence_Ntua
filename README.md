# Artificial_Intelligence_Ntua

This reposirory contains the projects carried out for the course of Artificial Intelligence in the National Technical University of Athens in 2022.

The following projects are included:

* Search Algorithms:  
  Mazes with two paths to their exit were created using a modification of the Randomized Prim algorithm. Afterwards, multiple search algorithms
  were implemented (Best First, Dijkstra, A*) using diffent distance metrics (Manhattan, Euclidean, Chebyshev), and the algorithms' time complexity and performance was studied.
  Finally multiple mazes following different requested criteria were created. The project was implemented using Python.

* Movie Recommender:  
  A movie recommendation system was created. For this purpose, a knowledge base was constructed and a set of rules was defined. The project was implemented using Prolog.

* Music Genre Classification:  
  A variety of classifiers (KNN, Naive Bayes, Multi-layer Perceptron) were implemented in order to classify songs to a genre based on a set of attributes ("acousticness", "danceability", "energy", and more). The project was implemented using Python.
